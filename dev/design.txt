NoTeX Package Manager

Requirements
+ work with standard virtualenv (as e.g. package.file.function, not package.version.file.function
+ directory per project
~ share between projects
~ remove unused packages

- a project could have multiple main documents, so it's not trivial to derive an index for a 'project'. Also, should multiple projects be able to share environment? And should people be able to update some kind of path (and then how should they fill their directories?)
- what about packages that have external requirements like through pip?

Limit the use of environment variables but retain maximum flexibility by using a variable "NOTEX_CONFIG_FILE"
  which isn't set by default but can be used to overrule any settings (e.g. for virtualenvs)

Package manager should have a help command that prints the readme of a package, e.g.
  ntp help catgifs
  ntp install catgifs>=7.0
(Then if there's an editor in the future, it can use that)
