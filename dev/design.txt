NoTeX Package Manager

Requirements
+ work with standard virtualenv (as e.g. package.file.function, not package.version.file.function
+ directory per project
~ share between projects
~ remove unused packages

Limit the use of environment variables but retain maximum flexibility by using a variable "NOTEX_CONFIG_FILE"
  which isn't set by default but can be used to overrule any settings (e.g. for virtualenvs)
